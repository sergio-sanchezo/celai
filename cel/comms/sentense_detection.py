    text = """Holi is a popular ancient Hindu festival https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD, also known as the "Festival of Colors" or the "Festival of Love." The festival celebrates the arrival of spring, the end of winter, the blossoming of love, and for many it's a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships. It is also celebrated as a thanksgiving for a good harvest. Holi is typically celebrated in India, Nepal, and other parts of the world with significant populations of Hindus or people of Indian origin. The festival has spread to parts of Europe and North America as a spring celebration of love, frolic, and colors. Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with a Holika Dahan where people gather, perform religious rituals in front of the bonfire, and pray that their internal evil be destroyed the way Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, was killed in the fire. The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi â€“ a free-for-all festival of colors, where participants play, chase and color each other with dry powder and colored water, with some carrying water guns and colored water-filled balloons for their water fight. The festival also provides an opportunity to enjoy seasonal foods and delicacies, socialize, and enjoy festive activities. While Holi is an ancient festival in India and Nepal, it is now celebrated in many places across the world."""
