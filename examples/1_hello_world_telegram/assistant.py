Hello World AI Assistant Example
---------------------------------

This is a simple example of an AI Assistant implemented using the Cel.ai framework.
It serves as a basic demonstration of how to get started with Cel.ai for creating intelligent assistants.

Framework: Cel.ai
License: MIT License

This script is part of the Cel.ai example series and is intended for educational purposes.

Usage:
------
Configure the required environment variables in a .env file in the root directory of the project.
The required environment variables are:
- WEBHOOK_URL: The webhook URL for the assistant, you can use ngrok to create a public URL for your local server.
- TELEGRAM_TOKEN: The Telegram bot token for the assistant. You can get this from the BotFather on Telegram.
- OPENAI_API_KEY: The OpenAI API key for the assistant.

Then run this script to see a basic AI assistant in action.

Note:
-----
Please ensure you have the Cel.ai framework installed in your Python environment prior to running this script.

# Register the connector with the gateway

# Then start the gateway and begin processing messages
